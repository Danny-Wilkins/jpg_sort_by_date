# jpg_sort_by_date
A small Python program that takes my pictures and sorts them by date.

Just something quick I threw together, probably buggy, not really intended for more than one use or it will probably overwrite files and do all kinds of stupid and unnecessary things.
Because it is a quick, lazy program, no error checking or anything of the sort has been included. Please don't try to run this on your computer.
